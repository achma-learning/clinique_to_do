# Project Overview

This directory (`clinique_to_do`) contains a web-based interactive medical observation checklist. It serves as a guide for medical practitioners to ensure all essential points are covered during a patient consultation and examination. The project aims to provide a standardized template for medical observations, with future plans to expand into specialized checklists and export functionalities.

# Key Files

*   `index.html`: The main interactive checklist document. It includes HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive elements (section toggling, reset button, and checkbox logic).
*   `README.md`: Provides a brief overview of the project's purpose.
*   `idea.txt`: Outlines the future development ideas for the project, such as creating specialized checklists (e.g., neurology, cardiology) and implementing a `.docx` export feature.
*   `main/observation.txt`: A detailed textual guide that likely served as a source or reference for the content of the `index.html` checklist. It describes the comprehensive steps for patient identity, consultation motif, antecedents, and history of illness.
*   `backup/`: Contains older versions of the `index.html` file (`v1.html`, `v2.html`) and potentially other historical data.
*   `ressources/`: Contains various PDF and text documents related to medical observations, guides, and academic theses, serving as reference materials.

# Usage

*   To use the checklist, simply open `index.html` in a web browser.
*   The checklist is interactive: sections can be expanded/collapsed, checkboxes can be marked, and there's a reset button to clear all selections.
*   The project can be developed further based on the ideas outlined in `idea.txt`.
